<p>This translation of Terence was published by Harper &amp; Brothers as
the second part of an omnibus volume also containing the 1853 Riley
translation (prose, with notes and commentary). The Riley portion has
been released as <a href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/22188">a
separate e-text</a>.</p>

<p>This e-text includes readings from the 1768 second edition of Colman,
shown along the right side of the screen. In general, only differences
in wording are included; variations in spelling and punctuation were
disregarded, and stage directions are omitted unless significant. It is
not known whether the Harper’s text was based on the first edition of
Colman or some later edition. Where the Harper text was clearly in
error, the 1768 reading was substituted in the main text. Errors are
marked with mouse-hover popups:</p>

set from the same plates. Page numbers in the right margin are from the
1768 Colman edition.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Simo.</span> I will; and this I must advise you

<p>The conduct of my son, my own intent,</p>
<p>And what part you’re to act, you’ll know at once.</p>
<p>For my son, Sosia, now to manhood grown,</p>
<p>Had freer scope of living: for before</p>
<p>How might you know, or how indeed divine</p>
<p>His disposition, good or ill, while youth,</p>
<p>Fear, and a master, all constrain’d him?</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Sosia.</span> True.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Simo.</span> Though most, as is the bent of
youth, apply</p>
<p>Their mind to some one object, horses, hounds,</p>
<p>Or to the study of philosophy;</p>
<span class = "pagenum harper">369</span>
<p>Yet none of these, beyond the rest, did he</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">5</span>
<p>Pursue; and yet, in moderation, all.</p>
<p>I was o’erjoy’d.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Sosia.</span> And not without good cause.</p>

<p>Of Life, too much of one thing’s good for nothing.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Simo.</span> So did he shape his life to bear

<span class = "charname">Sosia.</span> He rul’d his life</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Simo.</span> Meanwhile, ’tis now about three
years ago,</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">6</span>
<p>A certain woman from the isle of Andros,</p>
<p>Came o’er to settle in this neighborhood,</p>
<p>By poverty and cruel kindred driv’n:</p>
<p>Handsome and young.</p>

<p class = "first">

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Simo.</span> At first</p>
<p>Modest and thriftily, though poor, she liv’d,</p>
<p>With her own hands a homely livelihood</p>
<p>Scarce earning from the distaff and the loom.</p>
<p>But when a lover came, with promis’d gold,</p>
<p>Another, and another, as the mind</p>
<p>Falls easily from labor to delight,</p>
<p>She took their offers, and set up the trade.</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">7</span>
<p>They, who were then her chief gallants, by chance</p>
<p>Drew thither, as oft happen with young men</p>
<p>My son to join their company. <ins class = "correction second" title

<p>Said I within myself, “he’s smit! he has it!”</p>
<p>And in the morning as I saw their servants</p>
<p>Run to and fro, I’d often call, “here, boy!</p>
<p>Prithee now, who had Chrysis yesterday?”</p>
<p>The name of this same Andrian.</p>

<p>He supp’d, and paid his reck’ning.”&mdash;I was glad.</p>
<p>Another day I made the like inquiry,</p>
<p>But still found nothing touching Pamphilus.</p>
<p>Thus I believ’d his virtue prov’d, and hence</p>
<p>Thought him a miracle of continence:</p>
<p>For he who struggles with such spirits, yet</p>
<p>Holds in that commerce an unshaken mind,</p>
<span class = "pagenum harper">370</span>
<p>May well be trusted with the governance</p>
<p>Of his own conduct. Nor was I alone</p>
<p>Delighted with his life, but all the world</p>

<p>With one accord said all good things, and prais’d</p>
<p>My happy fortunes, who possess’d a son</p>
<p>So good, so lib’rally disposed.&mdash;In short</p>
<p>Chremes, seduc’d by this fine character,</p>
<p>Came of his own accord, to offer me</p>
<p>His only daughter with a handsome portion</p>
<p>In marriage with my son. I lik’d the match;</p>
<p>Betroth’d my son; and this was pitch’d upon,</p>
<p>By joint agreement, for the wedding-day.</p>

<p class = "first">

so?</p>

<p class = "first">

<p>Let him remember he was the aggressor:</p>
<p><i>He</i>, who translating many, but not well,</p>

<p>“A Thief,” he cried, “no Poet gives this piece.</p>
<p>Yet has he not deceived us: for we know,</p>
<p>The Colax is an ancient comedy</p>

If that’s the Poet’s crime, it is a crime</p>

<p>Wherein is drawn the character of Colax</p>
<p>The parasite, and the vain-glorious soldier;</p>
<p>Which characters, he scruples not to own,</p>
<p>He to his Eunuch from the Greek transferr’d:</p>

Yet if to other Poets ’tis not lawful</p>

<p>I would entreat you, therefore, not to lean</p>
<p>To tales of slander, rather than of candor.</p>
<p>Be favorable; nurse with growing hopes</p>
<p>The bards, who give you pleasing novelties;</p>
<p><i>Pleasing</i> I say, not such as <i>His</i> I mean,</p>
<p>Who lately introduc’d a breathless slave,</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> Of my son, Chremes?</p>

<p class = "first">

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Hold!</p>
<p>He cares not you should know of his return,</p>
<p>And dreads your sight because of his late trespass.</p>
<p>He fears, besides, your old severity</p>
<p>Is now augmented.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> Did not you inform him</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> Wherefore, Chremes?</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Because ’twould injure both
yourself and him</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> I can not help it. Too long, much
too long,</p>
<p>I’ve been a cruel father.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Ah, my friend,</p>
<p>You run into extremes; too niggardly,</p>
<p>Or, too profuse; imprudent either way.</p>
<p>First, rather than permit him entertain</p>
<p>A mistress, who was then content with little,</p>
<p>And glad of any thing, you drove him hence:</p>
<p>Whereon the girl was forc’d against her will,</p>
<p>To grow a common gamester for her bread:</p>
<p>And now she can’t be kept without much cost,</p>
<p>You’d squander thousands. For to let you know</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">270</span>
<p>How admirably madam’s train’d to mischief,</p>
<p>How finely form’d to ruin her admirers,</p>
<p>She came to my house yesternight with more</p>
<p>Than half a score of women at her tail,</p>
<p>Laden with clothes and jewels.&mdash;If she had</p>
<p>A Prince to her gallant, he could not bear</p>
<p>Such wild extravagance: much less can you.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> Is she within too?</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> She within! Aye, truly.</p>
<p>I’ve found it to my cost: for I have given</p>
<p>To her and her companions but one supper;</p>
<p>And to give such another would undo me.</p>
<p>For, not to dwell on other circumstances,</p>
<p>Merely to taste, and smack, and spirt about.</p>
<p>What quantities of wine has she consum’d!</p>
<p><i>This is too rough</i>, she cries; <i>some softer, pray!</i></p>
<p>I have pierc’d every vessel, ev’ry cask;</p>
<p>Kept ev’ry servant running to and fro:</p>
<p>All this ado, and all in one short night!</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">271</span>
<p>What, Menedemus, must become of you,</p>
<p>Whom they will prey upon continually?</p>
<p>Now, afore Heaven, thinking upon this,</p>
<p>I pitied you.</p>

<div class = "split">

<p class = "first">

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Mene.</span> What shall I do then?</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "charname">Chrem.</span> Any thing much rather</p>

<p>And privately contriving how to do’t.</p>
<p>There’s Syrus, and that little slave of yours</p>
<p>In an eternal whisper: the young men</p>
<p>Consulting too together: and it were</p>
<p>Better to lose a talent by these means,</p>
<p>Than on your plan a mina: for at present</p>
<p>Money is not the question, but the means</p>
<p>To gratify the youth the safest way.</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">272</span>

<div class = "second">

<p>Ah, what a window to debauchery</p>

<p>As will embitter even life itself;</p>
</div>

<p>And that you’d rather hazard life, and wealth,</p>
<p>Than part from him; ah, Menedemus, what</p>
<p>A window to debauchery you’ll open!</p>
<p>Nay, life itself will grow a burden to you;</p>
<p>For too much liberty corrupts us all.</p>
<p>Whatever comes into his head, he’ll have;</p>
<p>Nor think if his demand be right or wrong.</p>
<p>You, on your part, to see your wealth and son</p>
<p>Both wreck’d, will not be able to endure.</p>
<p>You’ll not comply with his demands; whereon</p>

<p>Never did man lay down so fair a plan,</p>
<p>So wise a rule of life, but fortune, age,</p>
<p>Or long experience made some change in it;</p>
<p>And taught him that those things he thought he knew</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">89</span>
<p>He did not know, and what he held as best,</p>
<p>In practice he threw by. The very thing</p>
<p>That happens to myself. For that hard life</p>
<p>Which I have ever led, my race near run,</p>
<p>Now in the last stage, I renounce: and why?</p>
<p>But that by dear experience I’ve been told,</p>
<p>There’s nothing so advantages a man</p>
<p>As mildness and complacency. Of this</p>
<p>My brother and myself are living proofs:</p>
<p>He always led an easy, cheerful life;</p>
<p>Good-humor’d, mild, offending nobody,</p>
<p>Smiling on all; a jovial bachelor,</p>
<p>His whole expenses centred in himself.</p>
<p>I, on the contrary, rough, rigid, cross,</p>
<p>Saving, morose, and thrifty, took a wife:</p>
<p>&mdash;What miseries did marriage bring!&mdash;had children;</p>
<p>&mdash;A new uneasiness!&mdash;and then besides,</p>
<p>Striving all ways to make a fortune for them,</p>
<p>I have worn out my prime of life and health:</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">90</span>
<p>And now, my course near finish’d, what return</p>
<p>Do I receive for all my toil? Their hate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my brother, without any care,</p>
<p>Reaps all a father’s comforts. Him they love,</p>
<p>Me they avoid: to him they open all</p>
<p>Their secret counsels; doat on him; and both</p>
<p>Repair to him; while I am quite forsaken.</p>
<p>His life they pray for, but expect my death.</p>
<p>Thus those, brought up by my exceeding labor,</p>
<p>He, at a small expense, has made his own:</p>
<p>The care all mine, and all the pleasure his.</p>
<p>&mdash;Well then, let me endeavor in my turn</p>
<p>To teach my tongue civility, to give</p>
<p>With open-handed generosity,</p>
<p>Since I am challeng’d to’t!&mdash;and let me too</p>
<p>Obtain the love and reverence of my children!</p>
<p>And if ’tis bought by bounty and indulgence,</p>
<p>I will not be behind-hand.&mdash;Cash will fail:</p>

<p>At length, by hammering on marriage still,</p>

<p>Our time to Phædria. Opposite the school,</p>
<p>Whither she went to take her lessons, stood</p>
<p>A barber’s shop, wherein most commonly</p>
<p>We waited her return. Hither one day</p>
<p>Came a young man in tears: we were amaz’d,</p>
<span class = "pagenum colman">211</span>

<p>Not far from hence, a miserable virgin</p>
<p>Lamenting her dead mother. Near the corpse</p>
<p>She sat; nor friend, nor kindred, nor acquaintance,</p>
<p>Except one poor old woman, was there near</p>
<p>To aid the funeral. I pitied her:</p>
<p>Her beauty, too, was exquisite.&mdash;In short,</p>
<p>He mov’d us all: and Antipho at once</p>
<p>Cried, “Shall we go and visit her?”&mdash;Why, aye,</p>
<p>“I think so,” said the other; “let us go!”</p>
<p>“Conduct us, if you please.”&mdash;We went, arriv’d.</p>
<p>And saw her.&mdash;Beautiful she was indeed!</p>
<p>More justly to be reckon’d so, for she</p>
<p>Had no additions to set off her beauty.</p>
<p>Her hair dishevel’d, barefoot, woe-begone,</p>
<p>In tears, and miserably clad: that if</p>
<p>The life and soul of beauty had not dwelt</p>
<p>Within her very form, all these together</p>
<p>Must have extinguish’d it.&mdash;The spark, possess’d</p>
